A simple hack to enable WYSIWYG editor TinyMCE on the comment field.

== Description ==

Why the need of a preview box if you have the What You See Is What You Get Editor in the same place as your visitors type in the comments?

This plugin turns the comment field from a primitive <textfield> into a WYSIWYG editor, using the internal [TinyMCE](http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/) library bundled with WordPress 2.0 or up, without the need of another separate installation. Functions that only available to writers like adding images were removed and will not show up in the toolbar.

== Screenshots ==

1. TinyMCEComments in action.
2. Admin interface.

== Installation ==

1. Extract the zip into the wp-content/plugins directory
1. Activate the plugin through the Admin panel of your WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this support ${insert plugin name here} and ${insert another plugin name here}? =

Short answer: no.
Long answer: Unless that developer modify his/her **OWN** code to use the JS function to insert HTML into the TinyMCE box, no.

= Will there be any security issues when I use this plugin? =

No. Actually sanity checking for comments are doing in backend, i.e. WordPress filters. This only change the way user input the comment, and how the sanity check are still controlled by WordPress code. And I haven't touch a single bit of that. If you think this plugin poses vulnerabilities, comment boxes with original flavour will also. Go figure.

= May I have comment picture support with this plugin? =

A big **NO**. Letting user post picture to your blog sounds dangerous to me, as they could place ads, paste invisible tracking bug, and all other nasty things. However if you insist to do so, you may try check how the comment filter works in WordPress.

= How do I set the width of the box? It's too wide/narrow! =

In dashboard go the "Theme editor" under "Design". Find and click the link "Comments (comments.php)" on the right hand side. Find the line with the tag `<textarea>` with `name="comment"` inside. Search for "cols" and modify the number assigned to it as you wish.

= I've activated the plugin but the WYSIWYG editor is not appearing! What should I do? =

First you should check if you are using a theme that is not following the standard design guideline. The comment box should have a id equal to "comment". The comment.php should have the line `<?php do_action('comment_form', $post->ID); ?>`. Check with the theme designer for that if you don't understand.

One more place to look at is the init script generated by the plugin. You could see it by going to http://yourdomain.com/wp_path/wp-content/plugins/tinymcecomment/tinyMCEComments.php .In the first line find `tinyMCE.addI18n`. If the symbols following is `({:{`, then please remove the file and load the page again. (This problem occurs  when you are upgrading to 0.4.4-3 from older versions.

== Other Notes ==

= JavaScript API =

TinyMCEComments provides a JavaScript function insertHTML(text) which could be used by other plugins on the same page. It is used for inserting customized content generated by other plugins into the TinyMCE editor.

= Akismet =

Some users report this plugin triggers false positives. I'm not sure, since I don't use Akismet, but after [asking](http://mk.netgenes.org/my-plugins/mcecomments/) help and advice from one of the developers from Akismet, they said that shouldn't matter. But if you are one of the victims, I suggest you to switch your anti-spam plugin.
