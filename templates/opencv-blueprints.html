    <h2>In depth</h2>

    <p>Computer vision is becoming accessible to a large audience of software developers who can leverage mature libraries such as OpenCV. However, developers may struggle to ensure that their solutions are sufficiently well optimized, well trained, robust, and adaptive in real-world conditions. This book provides exactly that.</p>

        <h3>Getting more out of your camera</h3>
        <p>Squeezing pixels out of your camera - this chapter covers and compares kinds of cameras for different jobs. By the end, you'll know in fine detail what makes camera systems work and how you can exploit them for maximum performance.</p>
        <p>Questions like how do we see <strong>fast changes</strong> in a scene, how do we <strong>see through the dark</strong> and how to <strong>purchase good lenses</strong> will be answered.</p>

        <h3>Build a camera trap</h3>
        <p>Noticed how nature photographers have the perfect HDR shots of animals in the wild? In this chapter, you build a system that can let you do exactly that. Whether it is deer in your backyard or red pandas on your next hiking trip, you'll be able to capture amazing photographs.</p>
        <p>These <strong>automated systems</strong> can be deployed wherever you go and let you capture <strong>National Geographic style photographs</strong> without safety concerns.</p>

        <h3>Recognize facial expressions</h3>
        <p>As computer vision matures, understanding humans seems to be the next logical step. In this chapter, you learn about various machine learning and computer vision techniques to <strong>recognize if a person is happy, sad, disgusted</strong>, etc.</p>
        <p>Humans can do this instinctively - after reading this chapter, you can get your CPU to achieve the same results!</p>

        <h3>Panoramas on the Android NDK</h3>
        <p>Learn how to build panoramas using OpenCV's android port. This is one classic application for mobile vision systems whether on robots or on a consumer device. In this chapter, you'll learn about the details of Android, JNI and using OpenCV on such platforms.</p>
        <p><strong>A must if you're getting started with mobile app development and OpenCV.</strong></p>

        <h3>Object detection</h3>
        <p>This chapter talks about the Viola-Jones cascade classifier in depth. Not just training new classifiers but how to collect data is also covered. <strong>Rotation invariance</strong> in HAAR classifiers - something not supported by OpenCV at the moment - is also described and solved!</p>
        <p>Later, we look at how to integrate the <strong>GPU</strong> into this operation and how it affects performance.</p>

        <h3>Biometric authentication</h3>
        <p>If you were to build a biometric authentication system, how would you go about it? This chapter deals with face recognition, <strong>fingerprints</strong> and <strong>iris recognition</strong>. Also learn about the various machine learning techniqes - k-nearest, SVMs, neural networks and PCA.</p>
        <p>This chapter is packed - 'nuff said!</p>

        <h3>Gyroscopic video stabilization</h3>
        <p>Use a phone's gyroscope to stabilize a video. Using just feature points is not enough in real-life situations. Complement your feature points with <strong>motion data from the real-world</strong>. The chapter talks about acquiring two streams of data (video and motion) and processing them in synchronicity.</p>
        <p>By the end, you'll be able to create <strong>Instagram's Hyperlapse</strong> style videos just with OpenCV!</p>
